# Write a function named std_dev that accepts a list of real numbers X as argument. It should return the standard deviation of the points given by the following formula:
# Here, Xiâ€‹ refers to the element X[i] in the list and X refers to the arithmetic mean of the numbers in X. Try to use list-comprehension wherever possible. However, we won't be evaluating you on this.
