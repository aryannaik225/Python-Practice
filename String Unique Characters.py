# Consider the following:

# A string, s, of length n where s= c0c1...cn-1.
# An integer, k, where k is a factor of n.
# We can split s into n/k substrings where each subtring, ti, consists of a contiguous block of k characters in s. Then, use each ti to create string ui such that:

# The characters in ui are a subsequence of the characters in ti.
# Any repeat occurrence of a character is removed from the string such that each character in ui occurs exactly once. In other words, if the character at some index j in ti occurs at a previous index < j in ti, then do not include the character in string ui.
# Given s and k, print n/k lines where each line i denotes string ui.

# Example
# s = 'AAABCADDE'
# k = 3

# There are three substrings of length 3 to consider: 'AAA', 'BCA' and 'DDE'. The first substring is all 'A' characters, so u1 = 'A'. The second substring has all distinct characters, so u2 = 'BCA'. The third substring has 2 different characters, so u3 = 'DE'. Note that a subsequence maintains the original order of characters encountered. The order of characters in each subsequence shown is important.

# Function Description

# Complete the merge_the_tools function in the editor below.

# merge_the_tools has the following parameters:

# string s: the string to analyze
# int k: the size of substrings to analyze

# Prints
# Print each subsequence on a new line. There will be n/k of them. No return value is expected.

# Input Format
# The first line contains a single string, s.
# The second line contains an integer, k, the length of each substring.
